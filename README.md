## About The Project

![ShofferStop](https://res.cloudinary.com/mayur28/image/upload/v1662282866/ShofferStop_hj5rxw.png)

As you have already know from my [portfolio](https://www.mayuragarwal.in/) that my focussed is on creating the user-friendly websites that deliver over the top experience. It delivers clean and easy-to-use user-experience with excellent responsiveness. Some key points which I keep in mind while developing the projects:

- Must provide clean and easy-to-use experience.
- Must provide better responsiveness for all screen sizes.

### Features

- Built a full-stack web app to reduce extra efforts required for storing and remembering DSA problems that provides attractive and user-friendly interface.
- Added the search, sort and filter features to easily find and provides ease of use.
- Added the account information support so that user can modify and also provided email support for password reset and account verification.
- Used React.js, Spring Boot and SQL.
- Utilized Ant-Design for better visualization.
